# Makefile for Jupyterlab extensions version 1.43
# changelog:
#   1.43 - the auth gate in `test` loads the source tree being released, not the wheel
#          the last `make install` left in site-packages: `python script.py` puts only
#          the script's own directory on sys.path, and `publish` runs `test` before
#          `install`, so the gate checked the previous build.
#   1.42 - increment_version moves from `publish` onto `install`, so every
#          `make install` raises the patch version again, as it did through 1.40.
#          `publish` reaches it through `install` and still raises it exactly once;
#          `make build` alone leaves the version as it is. Requested on 2026-09-25.
#   1.41 - increment_version moves off `build` and onto `publish`; `publish` gains
#          `test`; the metadata commit and push happen BEFORE either registry is
#          written to; `npm install` and package-lock.json are dropped.
#          Measured on 2026-09-20 against jupyterlab_advanced_paste_content_extension.
#          With increment_version on the build chain, a routine `make install`
#          rewrote a deliberately pinned 1.0.0, and a build that FAILED in tsc still
#          consumed the bump - 1.0.0 became 1.0.2 for one artefact that never
#          existed. No published version can be rebuilt, because building it again
#          produces the next one. The release path also never reached `test`: the
#          string `test` appeared nowhere in publish's prerequisite chain, so jest,
#          pytest and check_auth.py - the gate that exists to catch a handler
#          missing @tornado.web.authenticated - could not block a release.
#          `git push` ran AFTER both uploads and aborts outright on a repository
#          with no remote, leaving npm and PyPI written and the operator reading a
#          red target; and an npm success followed by a twine failure forks the two
#          registries permanently, because npm never re-serves a consumed version.
#          Committing first costs nothing when a later step fails.
#          `$(NPM) install` ran immediately before `jlpm install`, writing a
#          package-lock.json that nothing reads - CI installs with jlpm, and npm
#          honours `overrides` rather than the `resolutions` these projects pin
#          with. `git add` then named that file, and on a project which never
#          produces it the add fails on an unmatched pathspec, so the commit and
#          push never run at all.
#   1.40 - publish stages yarn.lock in the post-publish commit. It staged only
#          package.json and package-lock.json, and `git add package.json` takes every
#          change in that file, so a dependency added since the last commit went out
#          without its yarn.lock entry. CI installs with an immutable lockfile and
#          failed both workflows on that commit with YN0028 "The lockfile would have
#          been modified by this install" (measured on 2026-09-14, release 1.0.12 of
#          jupyterlab_advanced_markdown_viewer_extension). The staged yarn.lock is the
#          one `jlpm install` wrote for the build that was published.
#   1.39 - upgrade no longer runs `npm audit fix --force`; it reports with
#          `jlpm npm audit --recursive` instead. Measured on six extensions on
#          2026-09-08: the forced fix rewrote every @jupyterlab/* range to a 0.x
#          release predating JupyterLab 4 (application ^0.18.6, testutils ^0.2.4,
#          rendermime ^0.18.4) while printing that it would install 4.6.3, and
#          because npm updates a yarn.lock it finds, it rewrote the Yarn Berry
#          lockfile in the Yarn 1 format. Every project had to restore package.json
#          and both lockfiles from git by hand. Any `npm audit fix`, forced or not,
#          rewrites yarn.lock the same way, so the target reports advisories and
#          changes nothing; `jlpm up` remains the one upgrade step. The report exits
#          1 whenever an advisory stands, hence the `|| true`.
#   1.38 - keep `python -m build` as the build command, approve blocked npm install
#          scripts, and audit-fix on upgrade.
#          A local edit in one project had swapped `python -m build` for
#          `jupyter-builder build`; canonical 1.37 never carried that. Measured, the
#          swap breaks the build twice over. jupyter-builder emits
#          no sdist and no wheel, so nothing populated dist/ - and `install`
#          (pip install dist/*.whl) plus `publish` (twine upload dist/*) both read
#          dist/, so publish pushed the npm tarball and then died at twine with the
#          npm version already consumed and unrepublishable. It also exits 1 outright
#          when run after `clean`: "Cannot find module lib/index.js", because it never
#          runs tsc. `python -m build` needs no help - its hatch-jupyter-builder hook
#          runs the pyproject `build_cmd` (build:prod = tsc + labextension) during the
#          sdist stage, then builds the wheel from that sdist. Verified from a tree
#          with no lib/, no labextension/ and no dist/: both artefacts, exit 0.
#          publish now asserts dist/ holds a wheel and an sdist BEFORE the npm push,
#          so a broken build cannot desynchronise the two registries.
#          npm >= 11.6 blocks dependency install scripts until approved and records
#          the approval in package.json under "allowScripts", so a transitive
#          package needing a lifecycle script installs unbuilt and fails at runtime.
#          install_dependencies now approves every package in ALLOW_SCRIPTS_PKGS.
#          upgrade runs `npm audit fix --force` after `jlpm up`. WARNING: --force
#          accepts breaking changes, including downgrades - on this project it
#          proposes @jupyterlab/testutils@0.2.4 in place of ^4.6.3. Review the diff
#          to package.json and the lockfiles after every upgrade. The trailing
#          `|| true` is required: npm audit fix exits 1 whenever any advisory
#          remains unfixed, which is the normal outcome, and would abort the target.
#          check_dependencies / install_dependencies now also gate the `build` module
#          and `jlpm` (supplied by the jupyter_builder distribution), the two commands
#          every build reaches for, so a fresh clone self-heals instead of dying
#          mid-build on a missing tool.
#   1.37 - pin the global install prefix to the nodeenv when installing yarn + rimraf.
#          `npm install -g` honours a user-level `prefix=` in ~/.npmrc even when run
#          from the nodeenv's own npm, so on any machine that sets one the binaries
#          landed in that prefix instead of $(NODEENV)/bin. check_dependencies tests
#          for $(NODEENV)/bin/yarn, which then never became true, so every make
#          invocation re-ran install_dependencies and reinstalled yarn - it never
#          reported "All dependencies are installed". Passing --prefix explicitly
#          overrides the config for that one command and leaves ~/.npmrc untouched.
#   1.36 - `test` runs the Python suite too, not just jlpm. It ran `jlpm test` alone,
#          so on any extension with a server side a Python regression passed local
#          verification and only failed in CI. pytest now runs whenever the package
#          has a tests/ directory, and is skipped with a message when it does not,
#          so frontend-only extensions are unaffected. No --cov: coverage is a CI
#          concern, and requiring pytest-cov would make `make test` fail on an
#          otherwise working dev env. Also corrects the author address to the
#          +github alias used everywhere else.
#   1.35 - resolve node and npm exclusively from the project-local nodeenv via $(NODE)
#          and $(NPM) instead of bare names, and read VERSION lazily at recipe time
#          rather than at parse time. VERSION := $(shell command -v node ...) was
#          evaluated before any target ran, so on a fresh clone (no .nodeenv yet) it
#          fell back to 0.0.0, increment_version's sed matched nothing, and the build
#          published the already-published version while printing a successful bump.
#          It only appeared to work where an ambient node happened to be on PATH.
#          increment_version now depends on check_dependencies and fails loudly when
#          the version cannot be read or does not actually change.
#   1.34 - build formats the lockfiles with `jlpm prettier` (the project's pinned
#          toolchain) instead of `npx prettier`, which fails with "prettier: Permission
#          denied" against a yarn-berry node_modules where the .cjs lacks the exec bit
#   1.33 - check_dependencies now also treats a missing/empty node_modules as a missing
#          dependency, and install_dependencies runs `jlpm install` to populate it, so
#          `make install`/`test` self-heal a fresh env without needing a full build first
#   1.32 - use a project-local nodeenv at .nodeenv/ instead of overwriting the python
#          prefix via `nodeenv -p` (which used to fail with "Text file busy" when the
#          existing node binary was held open). PATH=.nodeenv/bin:$PATH is exported so
#          every target transparently picks up the pinned local node + npm + yarn.
#          install_dependencies now guards each install step - only what's missing
#          gets installed. mrproper removes .nodeenv too.
#   1.31 - mrproper now removes ui-tests/node_modules (Playwright browser binaries)
#   1.30 - check twine in check_dependencies, ensure publish doesn't fail on missing twine
#   1.29 - replace yarn with jlpm, add prettier format, auto-commit and push after publish
#   1.28 - initial versioned Makefile
